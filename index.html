                            <p>Light roasts are roasted for the least amount of time. Lightly roasted beans generally reach an internal temperature of 356°F – 401°F, right after the first crack occurs. These beans tend to not have the oils on them because they haven’t been roasted at a high enough temperature. The longer a bean is roasted the more the heat pulls out the caffeine and the acidity. This means light roasts have the most caffeine (by volume) and the most acidity.</p>

They have a little bit more body than a light roast and less acidity. These roasts are considered to have balanced flavors. The acidity and body of a medium roast can vary but are usually somewhere in the middle.</p>

                            <p>The roasting temperature for a dark roast is between 464°F – 482°F. There are visible oils on dark roast beans. Dark roasts have sweeter flavors because the sugars in the coffee beans have time to caramelize. The longer roasting process helps it to develop a richer flavor and full body, which often leads to it having a buttery finish. They also have the least acidity of all coffee roasts.  Dark roasts have the least amount of caffeine because they’re roasted the longest. Dark roasts have the least amount of caffeine because they’re roasted the longest.</p>

                        <br/>
                        <h3>French Press:</h3>
                        <br/><p>I could easily consider this one my favorite method. 
                        <br/><br/>Straightforward, the French press method stands as a timeless favorite.
                        <br/><br/>You will need, of course, a french press, coffee... I personally grind my own since you will need a coarse grind; hot water(just off the boil), stirring utensil, and a timer(optional but helpful).
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <h4>Process:</h4>
                        <br/>

                            <p><br/>Preheat your French press by rinsing it with hot water(it helps maintain the temperature stability during brewing). Measure the coffee beans; I do around 7 grams per 200 ml of water(14 grams for a 360 ml cup. My own preference). Then add the coffee grounds to the bottom of the French press.
                            <br/>Carefully pour hot water over the coffee grounds(only enough to cover the coffee grounds), and stir to ensure even saturation. Allow the coffee to bloom for about 30 seconds(at this time I already have the timer running); Add the rest of the water, place the lid and wait the remaining of the 4 minutes in total.
                            <br/>When the timer stops, slowly press down the plunger in a smooth and steady motion. Once pressed, immediately pour the brewed coffee into your mug to prevent over-extraction.
                            <br/><br/>Take a moment to savor the aroma, and indulge in the rich, full-bodied flavor of your freshly brewed French press coffee!</p>

                        <p>Simplest way to enjoy a cup of coffee!
                        <br/><br/>The pour-over method is a popular brewing technique cherished for its simplicity and ability to highlight the nuanced flavors of coffee.
                        <br/><br/>
                        You will need a Pour-Over dripper, paper filter, coffee, hot water, pouring kettle and a timer(optional but helpful).
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <h4>Process:</h4>

                            <p><br/>
                            Place the pour-over dripper on top of your mug or carafe and insert a paper filter, and rinse the filter with hot water to remove any paper taste and preheat the brewing vessel.
                            <br/>
                             Weigh out the desired amount of coffee grounds according to your preferred coffee-to-water ratio. Grind the coffee to a medium-fine consistency, similar to coarse sand.
                            <br/>Place the coffee grounds in the rinsed filter and gently shake to level the bed.
                            <br/>Start the timer and pour a small amount of hot water (about twice the weight of the coffee grounds) over the grounds to fully saturate them. Allow the coffee to bloom for 30-45 seconds. 
                            <br/>After the blooming period, begin pouring hot water in a slow, steady stream over the coffee grounds in a circular motion. Continue pouring until you reach the desired brew weight, typically around 2-3 times the weight of the coffee grounds.
                            <br/>The entire brewing process should take approximately 3-4 minutes from start to finish.
                            <br/>Once the dripping has ceased, remove the pour-over dripper from the brewing vessel. Give the coffee a gentle stir to ensure uniformity and then serve immediately.</p>
